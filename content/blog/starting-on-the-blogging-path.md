After trying to blog and failing to continue writing I feel the need to start once more. Hopefully this time I'll be able to sit down and write about technical subjects that interest me.

My intention with this blog is to share findings and document my learning process as I build and work on different applications.

More to come soon and thanks for stopping by.
