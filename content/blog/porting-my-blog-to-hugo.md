I've just completed porting my blog from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is built with [Go](https://golang.org/) and has some nice features such as:

- Speed -- Hugo is blazing fast and can compile my site in few ms.
- Single executable -- Go generates a single executable that has no external dependencies.
- Tinkering -- I'm learning Go at the moment so this is a opportunity to get a handle in some aspects of the language (e.g. templating).

The site is served statically from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Hopefully this will remove friction and make it even easier to write more posts. A big thanks to the authors of [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and also to [Sustain](https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain), the theme currently used.
